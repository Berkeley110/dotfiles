git clone folder in home directory.
The file directory will be at:

~/.vim 

While in your home directory enter the following,

ln -s ~/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc 
ln -s ~/dotfiles/bash_aliases ./.bash_aliases
 
This will create symbolic links in the home dir for vim and bash.
Now we

cd ~/.vim
 
And perform the following,

git submodule init 
git submodule update 

This will initialize and download the submodules into ~/.vim/bundle/

To add your own vim plugins follow the following formula:

cd ~/.vim
git submodule add <insert your plugins git url here> bundle/<name of plugin>

This not only adds your plugin but adds its path to the .gitmodule file. Now when 
you want to check for updates you can just:

cd ~/.vim
git submodule sync

This will update all the plugins if needed.
